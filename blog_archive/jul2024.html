        <h2>An Idea for The End of the Doctor/The Next Doctor, if the timeless child/bigeneration didn't happen.</h2>
        <p><b>7-28-24</b></p>
        <p>The Doctor, on the last regeneration of his second regeneration cycle, now going by the name of 'the Curator', unbeknownst to the rest of the universe, returns to Gallifrey and takes up an apprentice. 
        For three centuries he instructs this apprentice, until he has passed on all of the necessary knowledge, and then he dies, and as the apprentice takes on the name of 'the Doctor', the universe faces a great threat. 
        For the Next Doctor, this is his greatest challenge yet, for his new companion, it's a wild ride.</p>

        <h2>I'm 20 years old!</h2>
        <p><b>7-25-2024</b></p>
        <p>I unceremoniously turned 20 today, with nothing of note happening. I got wished happy birthday by several relatives, but I don't want to tell anyone where I am at because i'm just not the kind of guy to make 
        a big deal out of it. I am looking forward to the weekend however, as my parents are coming up to have an early dinner with me on saturday. I don't know if I feel any different, just a bit more mature I guess.</p>
        <p>Anyway, hope you all have a great day and I will try to enjoy myself as well.</p>
        <p>Update 7-26-24: I got myself some soft serve ice cream today to celebrate a bit, because 1) I can't technically have ice cream, and 2) I wanted some kind of desert to celebrate.</p>

        <h2><i>Doctor Who</i> (1963) Season 21 thoughts</h2>
        <p><b>7-20-24</b></p>
        <p>This season of <i>Doctor Who</i> is a wild one, with the return of the silurians and sea devils in the first story, then a alien trying to make a re-enactment of a war violent, then some backstory for Turlough, 
        the return of the Daleks and the departure of Tegan, a Master story with the culmination of Turlough's arc and the addition of Peri to the crew, the final adventure of the Fifth Doctor, and the introduction of 
        Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor.</p>
        <p>Starting with the first story, <i>Warriors of the Deep</i>, the TARDIS materializes on a seabase in the year 2084, where they battle against the Silurians and Sea Devils to stop a missle launch. The second 
        story, <i>The Awakening</i>, has the TARDIS materializing in an english town in 1984 so Tegan can visit her grandfather (or uncle, I don't really remember which), but the people re-enacting the English Civl War 
        take them captive, after which they defeat a 'pure evil' alien entity known as the Malus. The third story, <i>Frontios</i>, has the TARDIS landing on the last human colony after a catastrophic event destoryed the
        earth, where they have to fight tractators which Turlough remembers because of ancestral memory, who are trying to pull down people from the surface to run their drill, so that they can use the gravity waves to pilot 
        the planet across the universe. The fourth story, <i>Resurrection of the Daleks</i>, had the TARDIS get trapped in a time corridor that is linking London 1984 and a prison ship in the future, where the doctor lands 
        in a warehouse at one end of the corridor, the find people who are controlled by the Daleks, so they use the TARDIS to Materialize in the prison ship and make their way to the Dalek ship to fight them. This story is 
        the first of my three favorites for this season. The fifth story, <i>Planet of Fire</i>, has the TARDIS landing on the Trion prison planet of Sarn, where the doctor has to face off against the Master to stop him from 
        destabilizing the planet. This is the second of my three favorites for this season. The sixth story, <i>The Caves of Androzani</i>, has the Doctor and Peri succumbing to Spectox toxaemia, with the only cure being 
        the milk from a queen bat. This story was the final of my three favorites for this season. The seventh story, <i>The Twin Dilemma</i>, has the Doctor, now in his sixth incarnation, and having episodes due to regeneration, 
        and Peri, finding an unconsious man, trying to rescue a pair of genius twins, and saving the planet of Jaconda from giant gastropods.</p>
        <p>All in all it was a wonderful season, the return of classic villians in the Silurians/Sea Devils and the Daleks was nice to see, and it was great to get more backstory on Turlough. It was sad to see Tegan go the way she 
        did, but we did get the introduction of a new companion in Peri. The Doctor's regeneration was emotional, as it always is, although I'm not too sure of Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor, he seems so full of himself and 
        arrogant, but hopefully he will soften up a bit.</p>

        <h2>My last wireless Xbox One controller broke</h2>
        <p><b>7-19-24</b></p>
        <p>So I have had this controller since I got the console second hand from my cousin back in 2018, and it has outlasted two brand new controllers one of the same cycle as this one, and a Series X controller. 
        I was hoping it would last for at least the forseeable future, but it too has broken, although in a minorly predictable way: the left joystick broke, as in broke-broke, it somehow snaped off the mechanical part 
        so it is just hanging loose.</p>
        <p>Ah well, just goes to show that everything has a lifespan, and you can't necessarily avoid it.</p>
        <p>RIP White Xbox One Wireless Contoller (2016-2024).</p>

        <h2><i>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order</i> is absolutely ridiculous</h2>
        <p><b>7-13-24</b></p>
        <p>There is absolutely no reason this game should allow me to spend 15 minutes getting through a solid quarter of an area and not give me a single save spot, and I cannnot play a game under these conditions. 
        Truth be told, This is the sixth time I'm quitting for a unspecified period of time because of stupid ass mechanics. I do not understand any of the insane people who put themselves through this and enjoy it, 
        it makes utterly zero sense in my head, and I like to think I'm a pretty sensible person. But alas, I have to say that I think these people have no sense, nor care about anything, which would explain a lot honestly.</p>
        <p>Oh well, lesson of the day: don't play a game that will make me want to throw my controller into my television screen.</p>

        <h2><i>Doctor Who</i> (2005) Season 10 thoughts</h2>
        <p><b>7-13-23</b><p>
        <p>This season of <i>Doctor Who</i> is an emotional rollar-coaster, with two new companions in Bill Potts and Nardole, a new enemy in the Monks, and the return of old enemeies in the Ice Warriors and the Master.</p>
        <p>The first episode introduces Bill as she and the doctor are followed across the universe by a sentient puddle. The second episode is about robots who speak in emojis and turned a colony into fertilizer.
        The third episode is about a creature living under the Thames during the last great Frost Fair. The fourth episode is about a house made of cosmic woodlice trying to feed on Bill and her friends. The fifth episode 
        is about a space station that is trying to kill it's inhabitants off because the company doesn't deem them neccessary anymore.</p>
        <p>The sixth, seventh and eighth episodes are about the Monks and their plot to take over the world, which actually happens in the second, and then the Doctor, Bill, and Nardole have to save it in the last episode. The 
        ninth episode is about the Ice Warriors when they are just waking up after mars had become desolate. The tenth episode is about the ninth legion of the Roman Army disappearing into the night.</p>
        <p>The eleventh and twelfth episodes are about a giant spaceship that is trapped in the event horizon of a black hole, the rise of the Mondasian Cybermen, and Bill's Death. The last episode is about the Twelfth and First 
        Doctors trying to stop, and then help a memory saving system from taking a WWI British Army capitan back to his original point in time, but then end up taking him back themselves while changing the time slightly to let 
        him survive.</p>
        <p>All in all I loved this season dearly but it was sad to see the first companion death in the new series, and it was nice to see the return of the Saxon Master, and the return of the Ice Warriors as well.</p>

        <h2><i>Doctor Who</i> (1963) Season 20 thoughts</h2>
        <p><b>7-12-23</b><p>
        <p>This season of <i>Doctor Who</i> is pretty action-packed, with the return to Galifrey and Omega in the first story, then the Mara, the return of the Brigadier and addition of Turlough to the Crew, 
        the departure of Nyssa, and the return of the Master, with a multi-Doctor Special to tie it all off.</p>
        <p>Starting with the first story, <i>Arc of Infinity</i>, The doctor's Biodata gets illegally transmitted to an anti-matter being (which I immediately reconized as Omega from the Season 10 story 
        <i>The Three Doctors</i>), and also has Colin Baker as Commander Maxil, This story was the first of my three favorites this season. The second story <i>Snakedance</i>, has Tegan steer the tardis to Manussa without knowing, 
        causing the Doctor to question what happened. This story reintorduces the Mara, and it's homeworld, where it is then destroyed forever. The third story, <i>Mawdryn Undead</i> Sees the TARDIS landing on a spaceship
        suspended above earth, where they then go on to meet the Brigadier, Turlough who is tasked by the Black Guardian to kill the doctor and joins the TARDIS crew, and beings who tried to turn themselves into Time Lords
        but ended up just rotting away eternally, and who try to use the doctor for his remaining regenerations. The fourth story, <i>Terminus</i> sees the TARDIS materializing aboard a leper ship heading toward 
        the leper colony of Terminus which is situated at the center of the known universe. Nyssa gets sick and is taken into the so-called Forbidden zone to be cured. By the end Nyssa ends up staying at Terminus to help
        improve the curing process. The fifth story, <i>Enlightenment</i> Sees the TARDIS Materialize abord an Edwardian clipper ship piloted by Eternals who live outside of time and require Ephemerals or time dewellers to survive.
        These Eternals are in a race for Enlightement, the story ends with Turlough breaking the Black Guardian's hold on him, and draining his power for the time being, this story is the second of my favorites this season. 
        The sixth story, <i>The King's Demons</i> Sees the TARDIS materialize in 1215 before the Magna Carta is about to be signed, with King John seemingly in two places at once. This second King ends up being 
        a robot that's controlled by the Master, to try and change history. The last story is <i>The Five Doctors</i>, which has the Doctor's timeline split as he is scooped up by the timescoop and placed in the Death Zone, 
        which is located in the center of Time Lord Civilization on Galifrey. The Doctors' have to get to Rassilon's Tomb in the center of the zone, where President Berusa Confronted them and tried to claim immortality. This story
        was the third of my favorites this season.</p>
        <p>All in all it was a wonderful season, being propped up at the end by the 2h30m special, I was sad to see Nyssa go, but ultimately we gained a great (if somewhat questionable) character in Turlough.</p>

        <h2><i>Star Wars: Tales of the Empire</i> thoughts (a tad late)</h2>
        <p><b>7-12-24</b></p>
        <p>So first off let me just say that the animation is just absolutely gorgeous, and I cannot believe how good Greivous looks (although given that it's the first time we've seen him since <i>The Clone Wars</i>, 
        I think it's expected),  and Thrawn looks absolutely stunning in the TCW style.</p>
        <p>The first three episodes are interesting, and I love to see a fleshed out backstory for Morgan Elsbeth. The last 3 episodes are something I have wanted since <i>The Clone Wars</i>, to see what happens to 
        Bariss Offee after Her trial in TCW.</p>
        <p>All in all It was a great miniseries, and the extra lore is always something I will enjoy.</p>
