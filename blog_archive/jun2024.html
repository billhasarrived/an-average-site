        <h2><i>Minecraft</i> Version History Playthrough (1.0.0/1.1)</h2>
        <p><b>6/30/24</b></p>
        <p>A week or so back I had this Idea to play through every single major <i>Minecraft</i> Update so I could a) start a long term world and b) learn how to properly play the game. I originally started with version 1.0.0,
        but I then realized version 1.1 was mostly a QoL update, so I quickly upgraded the world. I soon got into the groove of things, completing several Achievements (in the milestone sense of the word, now known as Advancments) 
        along the way. I eventually took to clearing most of the surrounding forest and lighting up the rest of the area, and now I have a nice base of operations and spawn area. I have started the "On A Rail" Achievement, 
        which requires one to create a railway 1000 blocks long (or 1km). I still have to create a strip mine so I can find diamonds, but for now I'm living pretty well. I may end up streaming the rest of the updates after 
        I finish Trade School.</p>
        <p>Note: If you have Intel Integerated Graphics and Windows 11, you might have trouble getting the saves to work in versions older than 1.8 because of a graphical bug.</p>

        <h2>Website Issues in Firefox</h2>
        <p><b>6/24/24</b></p>
        <p>While I was adding the Media page, I noticed that <i>Firefox</i> has this weird issue where it displays basic HTML wrong. I added a link to the navbar for the page, and it is not formatting the navbar with any of
        the css elements I added, which work perfectly fine on a Chromium-based browser like <i>MS Edge</i>.</p> 
        <p>I couldn't figure out how to resolve this issue via HTML so for now I would suggest using a Chromium-based browser to view the webpage, as that is what I am using to develop it. If you have the know-how, 
        or even an idea on how to fix it, please contact me.</p>
        <p>Update: They fixed the navbar issue so use whatever browser you like :).<p>

        <h2><i>Fallout 4</i> Modding Retry (Success)</h2>
        <p><b>6/17/24</b></p>
        <p>I decided to try to mod <i>Fallout 4</i> again, and it turned out quite differently this time than it did before, as I decided to not only follow some guides for a more stable <i>Fallout 4</i> 
        (<a href="https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/intro.html">This one</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/3769/">This one</a>), but to learn a new mod manager
        (Mod Organizer 2 (will be refered to as MO2 from here on)). It was fairly easy following the guides, but learning MO2 was a bit tougher, though I am a fairly quick learner.</p> 
        <p>Once I got the base down, I hadn't experienced any hitches so I started installing mods on top. I built my modlist up to ~220 mods and then I tested it, and it worked flawlessly.
        But It didn't last long, because when I played for a bit longer and got to the bridge between Sanctuary Hills and Red Rocket, the bridge had no collision. so I looked it up and it turned out that
        the mod <i>Previsibines Repair Pack</i> had to be loaded at the bottom of the load order and that it was best to sort my load order with a tool called <i>Load Order Optimization Tool</i> (LOOT for short)
        which I had been avoiding because it completely messed up my load order last time. After I had gotten that sorted I had to restart to see the effects, which is extraneous because of the fact you have to
        play through the extremely script-heavy Pre-War sequence every time. So I downloaded a mod that allowed me to skip the Pre-War sequence and come out of Vault 111 with a basic set of loot. I had no issues
        the first time I used it, but after some of another mod's scripts got "overwritten" the mod started throwing up a modal dialouge every time I loaded into a game, so when I started a new game, the
        modal dialog tried to pop up, which interfered with the Fast Start mod. I was able to remove it, because thankfully I had no other mods that depended on it.</p>
        <p>I continued installing more mods, using <i>LOOT</i> to sort the LO after every mod. Eventually I installed a mod called <i>Pip-Boy Flashlight</i> because I thought it would help the atmosphere of the game,
        but the mod ended up causing a conflict with a Pip=Boy replacer mod that I used. At first I thought I had reached the BA2 limit, so I extracted the Pip-Boy replacer mod, but it didn't help, so I went to 
        download another replace mod, but I saw that it had a patch for the mod <i>Pip-Boy Flashlight</i>, so I looked to see if the mod had a patch, and it did, but I decided that I didn't actually need the other mod,
        so I just uninstalled it.<p>
        <p>I am now sitting happily at 320 mods, with a perfectly running game. This just goes to show, with the right know-how and enough elbow grease, you can get anything working well. I may eventually decide that
        I want that last mod, and install the patch, but for now I'm happy as can be (for a <i>Bethesda</i> game, and one that is as f*cked as <i>Fallout 4</i> is, that is).</p>
