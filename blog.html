      <h2><i>Doctor Who</i> (1963) Season 22 Thoughts</h2>
      <p><b>8-23-24</b></p>
      <p>This season of <i>Doctor Who</i> was action-packed, with the first story being a Cybermen story, a new location and enemies, the return of the Master and a new enemy in the Rani, a multi-doctor story with the return of 
      the Sontarans, then an adventure on a new world with H.G. Wells, and a Dalek story to finish it off.</p>
      <p> Starting with the first story, <i>Attack of the Cybermen</i>, the Doctor and Peri land in London in the 1980s after following a distress signal, which he goes looking for, then, running into trouble with some locals, 
      they follow them down to the sewers where they meet Lytton, who is working for the cyberman, and then they go to Telos to stop the Cyberman from changing history, while there they meet the Telosians, then Lytton gets 
      partially turned into a cyberman, and the doctor defeats the Cyber Controller. The second story, <i>Vengeance on Varos</i>, has the TARDIS experiencing power failures, so the Doctor lands on the nearby planet of Varos,
      where a special metal will help fix it, but they end up landing in the Punishment Dome, a place of torture and death for the entertainment of the miners of the planet. When the Doctor and Peri Leave they free one of the 
      prisoners, leading to a chase and the Capture of Peri and the doctor, where the people in charge try to figure out why he came. Then, Peri and one of the Prisoners are experimented on, the Doctor and one of the Prisoners 
      sent to be executed, but the doctor says why he is here, and tells the governor that the company that is buying the metal is not giving the planet the best price possible, so the governer doesn't kill them, and then they 
      go save peri and the others, The governer is put to a vote with Peri next to him, but a guard shoots the cell decay beam before it can hurt them too much. The third story, <i>The Mark of the Rani</i> has the tardis land in 
      1820s England, where they go to find a man named stevenson, when they run into the master who is trying to kill the doctor, and then the master runs into the rani and they collaborate, until the doctor comes in and foils 
      both of their plans, this story is the first of my three favorites.</p>
      <p>The fourth story, <i>The Two Doctors</i>, has the the Second doctor and Jamie being sent by the Time Lords to a Scientific research space station to try and stop dangerous experiments into time travel. 
      Then the Second Doctor is captured by the Sontarans and taken to earth while Jamie is left behind, and then the Sixth Doctor and Peri arrive at the research station, having to evade the hostile computer. After they fix the 
      computer, they find Jamie and Jamie tells them that the doctor was executed, and they head to earth to rescue him. On Earth, the Sontarans Have set up shop in a house in the Spanish countryside, and are experimenting on 
      the Second Doctor. The Sixth Doctor, Peri and Jamie infiltrate the house and try to rescue the Second Doctor, but the Scientist working with the Sontarans turn him into an Androgum, and the Sixth Doctor Peri and Jamie had 
      to chase him down. When they found him and brought him back, they cured him, and then the Sixth doctor was forced to make the Kartz-Reimer Capsule work by the sontarans, but took an important part before the Sontarans Used 
      it, and then defeated the Scientists, this story is the second of my three favorites. The fifth story, <i>Timelash</i>, has The Sixth Doctor and Peri getting caught in a Time Corridor that leads from the planet Karfel
      to 19th century Earth, as they are stuck in the corridor, they see a person pass down it, and then materialize on Karfel, where the Doctor is sent to retrieve a necklace on Earth, when they materialize, he meets a young 
      H.G. Wells, who stowes away on the Tardis, when they return, the Doctor finds Peri is missing, and is sent to the Borad, whom the doctor met in his third incarnation, he then sets up an plan to defeat the Borad by using 
      Crystals that move a person ahead 6 seconds in time, which he uses to great effect on the borad, after which he saves Peri, and then uses the Tardis as a shield to block a missile from blowing up the planet, 
      this story is the final of my three favorites. 
      The Sixth and final story, <i>Revelation of the Daleks</i>, Has the Sixth Doctor and Peri landing on the Planet Necros, where he intends on seeing an old friend cryogenicly frozen, but Davros, Posing as 'The Great Healer' 
      intends to put an end to the Doctor's meddling, and finally make the Daleks the Superior race, but the Doctor figures out his plan with the help of a mercenary, and defeats him.</p>
      <p>All in all it was a great seaon, and the Sixth Doctor is growing on me a bit. I really liked Colin Baker and Patrick Troughton together, I think the way they each played the doctor compliments each other. I also think 
      H.G. Wells was done really well, and I love that it says that the Doctor and the Tardis influences <i>The Time Machine</i>. Intrestingly enough, I did just realize that Peri was supposed to be an American, which make her
      character the first American Companion which is really cool, Now I'd love to see an actual American actor play a companion, maybe in Series 15 of the 2005 show.</p>

      <h2>My Thanks for an Updated <i>Doctor Who</i> Timeline</h2>
      <p><b>8-10-24</b></p>
      <p>I would like to express my thanks to Tim Bradley over at <a href="https://bradleybasement.wordpress.com/">Bradley's Basement</a> for keeping his amazing <i>Doctor Who</i> timelines up to date. I found them awhile ago, 
        and have been using them as a reference for when events occur in the Doctor's personal timeline, and for listening to the Big Finish Audio Dramas in order. It really has been an incredibly useful resource and I couldn't 
        thank him enough.</p>
      <p>Currently I am using the <a href="https://bradleybasement.wordpress.com/sci-fi/doctor-who/doctor-who-timelines/the-doctors-timelines-index/the-fifth-doctors-timeline/">Fifth Doctor's Timeline</a> to listen to and read 
        all of the Big Finish Audio Dramas and the print books.</p>

      <h2><i>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</i> Season 3 thoughts</h2>
      <p><b>8-6-24</b></p>
      <p>This season of <i>The Bad Batch</i> was absolutely amazing, with so many highs and lows, and everthing in between, the return of crosshair was awesome, and the ending was just so, so very good.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite parts is the Reunion episode which was great, with all the dynamics of someone who was initially good, then bad, returning and becoming better. I loved the send off so much because it just shows the 
        close of one chapter, and the opening of another.</p>
      <p>All in all, it was an absolute banger of a season and I loved every second of it. I am actually pretty excited to start <i>The Acolyte</i>, so that will be fun.</p>

      <h2>The Impact that <i>Avenged Sevenfold</i>'s Music has had on Me</h2>
      <p><b>8-5-24</b></p>
      <p><i>Avenged Sevenfold</i> are to me, masters of the genre, who really know how to create absolute bangers that can wrench at your heart and will tell a story that can change how you look at things.</p>
      <p>When I was first introduced to <i>Avenged Sevenfold</i> in my Sophmore year of High-School (2019), their music took me by storm. At that point in time I was new to Metal as a genre, I had started out with 
        Nu-Metal and Death Metal bands like <i>Slipknot</i> and <i>Orbit Culture</i>, but when I was told there was a band that did Call of Duty (specifically Black Ops) tie-in songs, I was skeptical that it would be good. 
        But as I listened to 'Carry On', I realized that they were way more than good, they were the pinnacle of melodic yet impactful Metal, and exactly what I was looking for. I continued on to listen to their
        albums starting with <i>'City of Evil'</i>, and now I would hate to imagine what my life would be like if I hadn't been introduced to them, and I do hope someday I will be able to go to a concert.</p>
      <p>Some of my Favorite songs are 'Bat Country', 'M.I.A.', 'Almost Easy', 'Afterlife', 'Danger Line', 'Victim', 'Crimson Day', 'Shepherd of Fire', 'Higher', 'Cosmic', 'Nobody', and 'Carry On'.</p>
