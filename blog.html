      <h2>My Thanks for an Updated <i>Doctor Who</i> Timeline</h2>
      <p><b>8-10-24</b></p>
      <p>I would like to express my thanks to Tim Bradley over at <a href="https://bradleybasement.wordpress.com/">Bradley's Basement</a> for keeping his amazing <i>Doctor Who</i> timelines up to date. I found them awhile ago, 
      and have been using them as a reference for when events occur in the Doctor's personal timeline, and for listening to the Big Finish Audio Dramas in order. It really has been an incredibly useful resource and I couldn't 
      thank him enough.</p>
      <p>Currently I am using the <a href="https://bradleybasement.wordpress.com/sci-fi/doctor-who/doctor-who-timelines/the-doctors-timelines-index/the-fifth-doctors-timeline/">Fifth Doctor's Timeline</a> to listen to and read 
      all of the Big Finish Audio Dramas and the print books.</p>

      <h2><i>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</i> Season 3 thoughts</h2>
      <p><b>8-6-24</b></p>
      <p>This season of <i>The Bad Batch</i> was absolutely amazing, with so many highs and lows, and everthing in between, the return of crosshair was awesome, and the ending was just so, so very good.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite parts is the Reunion episode which was great, with all the dynamics of someone who was initially good, then bad, returning and becoming better. I loved the send off so much because it just shows the 
      close of one chapter, and the opening of another.</p>
      <p>All in all, it was an absolute banger of a season and I loved every second of it. I am actually pretty excited to start <i>The Acolyte</i>, so that will be fun.</p>

      <h2>The Impact that <i>Avenged Sevenfold</i>'s Music has had on Me</h2>
      <p><b>8-5-24</b></p>
      <p><i>Avenged Sevenfold</i> are to me, masters of the genre, who really know how to create absolute bangers that can wrench at your heart and will tell a story that can change how you look at things.</p>
      <p>When I was first introduced to <i>Avenged Sevenfold</i> in my Sophmore year of High-School (2019), their music took me by storm. At that point in time I was new to Metal as a genre, I had started out with 
      Nu-Metal and Death Metal bands like <i>Slipknot</i> and <i>Orbit Culture</i>, but when I was told there was a band that did Call of Duty (specifically Black Ops) tie-in songs, I was skeptical that it would be good. 
      But as I listened to 'Carry On', I realized that they were way more than good, they were the pinnacle of melodic yet impactful Metal, and exactly what I was looking for. I continued on to listen to their
      albums starting with <i>'City of Evil'</i>, and now I would hate to imagine what my life would be like if I hadn't been introduced to them, and I do hope someday I will be able to go to a concert.</p>
      <p>Some of my Favorite songs are 'Bat Country', 'M.I.A.', 'Almost Easy', 'Afterlife', 'Danger Line', 'Victim', 'Crimson Day', 'Shepherd of Fire', 'Higher', 'Cosmic', 'Nobody', and 'Carry On'.</p>

      <h2>An Idea for The End of the Doctor/The Next Doctor, if the timeless child/bigeneration didn't happen.</h2>
      <p><b>7-28-24</b></p>
      <p>The Doctor, on the last regeneration of his second regeneration cycle, now going by the name of 'the Curator', unbeknownst to the rest of the universe, returns to Gallifrey and takes up an apprentice. 
      For three centuries he instructs this apprentice, until he has passed on all of the necessary knowledge, and then he dies, and as the apprentice takes on the name of 'the Doctor', the universe faces a great threat. 
      For the Next Doctor, this is his greatest challenge yet, for his new companion, it's a wild ride.</p>

      <h2>I'm 20 years old!</h2>
      <p><b>7-25-2024</b></p>
      <p>I unceremoniously turned 20 today, with nothing of note happening. I got wished happy birthday by several relatives, but I don't want to tell anyone where I am at because i'm just not the kind of guy to make 
      a big deal out of it. I am looking forward to the weekend however, as my parents are coming up to have an early dinner with me on saturday. I don't know if I feel any different, just a bit more mature I guess.</p>
      <p>Anyway, hope you all have a great day and I will try to enjoy myself as well.</p>
      <p>Update 7-26-24: I got myself some soft serve ice cream today to celebrate a bit, because 1) I can't technically have ice cream, and 2) I wanted some kind of desert to celebrate.</p>

      <h2><i>Doctor Who</i> (1963) Season 21 thoughts</h2>
      <p><b>7-20-24</b></p>
      <p>This season of <i>Doctor Who</i> is a wild one, with the return of the silurians and sea devils in the first story, then a alien trying to make a re-enactment of a war violent, then some backstory for Turlough, 
      the return of the Daleks and the departure of Tegan, a Master story with the culmination of Turlough's arc and the addition of Peri to the crew, the final adventure of the Fifth Doctor, and the introduction of 
      Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor.</p>
      <p>Starting with the first story, <i>Warriors of the Deep</i>, the TARDIS materializes on a seabase in the year 2084, where they battle against the Silurians and Sea Devils to stop a missle launch. The second 
      story, <i>The Awakening</i>, has the TARDIS materializing in an english town in 1984 so Tegan can visit her grandfather (or uncle, I don't really remember which), but the people re-enacting the English Civl War 
      take them captive, after which they defeat a 'pure evil' alien entity known as the Malus. The third story, <i>Frontios</i>, has the TARDIS landing on the last human colony after a catastrophic event destoryed the
      earth, where they have to fight tractators which Turlough remembers because of ancestral memory, who are trying to pull down people from the surface to run their drill, so that they can use the gravity waves to pilot 
      the planet across the universe. The fourth story, <i>Resurrection of the Daleks</i>, had the TARDIS get trapped in a time corridor that is linking London 1984 and a prison ship in the future, where the doctor lands 
      in a warehouse at one end of the corridor, the find people who are controlled by the Daleks, so they use the TARDIS to Materialize in the prison ship and make their way to the Dalek ship to fight them. This story is 
      the first of my three favorites for this season. The fifth story, <i>Planet of Fire</i>, has the TARDIS landing on the Trion prison planet of Sarn, where the doctor has to face off against the Master to stop him from 
      destabilizing the planet. This is the second of my three favorites for this season. The sixth story, <i>The Caves of Androzani</i>, has the Doctor and Peri succumbing to Spectox toxaemia, with the only cure being 
      the milk from a queen bat. This story was the final of my three favorites for this season. The seventh story, <i>The Twin Dilemma</i>, has the Doctor, now in his sixth incarnation, and having episodes due to regeneration, 
      and Peri, finding an unconsious man, trying to rescue a pair of genius twins, and saving the planet of Jaconda from giant gastropods.</p>
      <p>All in all it was a wonderful season, the return of classic villians in the Silurians/Sea Devils and the Daleks was nice to see, and it was great to get more backstory on Turlough. It was sad to see Tegan go the way she 
      did, but we did get the introduction of a new companion in Peri. The Doctor's regeneration was emotional, as it always is, although I'm not too sure of Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor, he seems so full of himself and 
      arrogant, but hopefully he will soften up a bit.</p>

      <h2>My last wireless Xbox One controller broke</h2>
      <p><b>7-19-24</b></p>
      <p>So I have had this controller since I got the console second hand from my cousin back in 2018, and it has outlasted two brand new controllers one of the same cycle as this one, and a Series X controller. 
      I was hoping it would last for at least the forseeable future, but it too has broken, although in a minorly predictable way: the left joystick broke, as in broke-broke, it somehow snaped off the mechanical part 
      so it is just hanging loose.</p>
      <p>Ah well, just goes to show that everything has a lifespan, and you can't necessarily avoid it.</p>
      <p>RIP White Xbox One Wireless Contoller (2016-2024).</p>

      <h2><i>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order</i> is absolutely ridiculous</h2>
      <p><b>7-13-24</b></p>
      <p>There is absolutely no reason this game should allow me to spend 15 minutes getting through a solid quarter of an area and not give me a single save spot, and I cannnot play a game under these conditions. 
      Truth be told, This is the sixth time I'm quitting for a unspecified period of time because of stupid ass mechanics. I do not understand any of the insane people who put themselves through this and enjoy it, 
      it makes utterly zero sense in my head, and I like to think I'm a pretty sensible person. But alas, I have to say that I think these people have no sense, nor care about anything, which would explain a lot honestly.</p>
      <p>Oh well, lesson of the day: don't play a game that will make me want to throw my controller into my television screen.</p>

      <h2><i>Doctor Who</i> (2005) Season 10 thoughts</h2>
      <p><b>7-13-23</b><p>
      <p>This season of <i>Doctor Who</i> is an emotional rollar-coaster, with two new companions in Bill Potts and Nardole, a new enemy in the Monks, and the return of old enemeies in the Ice Warriors and the Master.</p>
      <p>The first episode introduces Bill as she and the doctor are followed across the universe by a sentient puddle. The second episode is about robots who speak in emojis and turned a colony into fertilizer.
      The third episode is about a creature living under the Thames during the last great Frost Fair. The fourth episode is about a house made of cosmic woodlice trying to feed on Bill and her friends. The fifth episode 
      is about a space station that is trying to kill it's inhabitants off because the company doesn't deem them neccessary anymore.</p>
      <p>The sixth, seventh and eighth episodes are about the Monks and their plot to take over the world, which actually happens in the second, and then the Doctor, Bill, and Nardole have to save it in the last episode. The 
      ninth episode is about the Ice Warriors when they are just waking up after mars had become desolate. The tenth episode is about the ninth legion of the Roman Army disappearing into the night.</p>
      <p>The eleventh and twelfth episodes are about a giant spaceship that is trapped in the event horizon of a black hole, the rise of the Mondasian Cybermen, and Bill's Death. The last episode is about the Twelfth and First 
      Doctors trying to stop, and then help a memory saving system from taking a WWI British Army capitan back to his original point in time, but then end up taking him back themselves while changing the time slightly to let 
      him survive.</p>
      <p>All in all I loved this season dearly but it was sad to see the first companion death in the new series, and it was nice to see the return of the Saxon Master, and the return of the Ice Warriors as well.</p>

      <h2><i>Doctor Who</i> (1963) Season 20 thoughts</h2>
      <p><b>7-12-23</b><p>
      <p>This season of <i>Doctor Who</i> is pretty action-packed, with the return to Galifrey and Omega in the first story, then the Mara, the return of the Brigadier and addition of Turlough to the Crew, 
      the departure of Nyssa, and the return of the Master, with a multi-Doctor Special to tie it all off.</p>
      <p>Starting with the first story, <i>Arc of Infinity</i>, The doctor's Biodata gets illegally transmitted to an anti-matter being (which I immediately reconized as Omega from the Season 10 story 
      <i>The Three Doctors</i>), and also has Colin Baker as Commander Maxil, This story was the first of my three favorites this season. The second story <i>Snakedance</i>, has Tegan steer the tardis to Manussa without knowing, 
      causing the Doctor to question what happened. This story reintorduces the Mara, and it's homeworld, where it is then destroyed forever. The third story, <i>Mawdryn Undead</i> Sees the TARDIS landing on a spaceship
      suspended above earth, where they then go on to meet the Brigadier, Turlough who is tasked by the Black Guardian to kill the doctor and joins the TARDIS crew, and beings who tried to turn themselves into Time Lords
      but ended up just rotting away eternally, and who try to use the doctor for his remaining regenerations. The fourth story, <i>Terminus</i> sees the TARDIS materializing aboard a leper ship heading toward 
      the leper colony of Terminus which is situated at the center of the known universe. Nyssa gets sick and is taken into the so-called Forbidden zone to be cured. By the end Nyssa ends up staying at Terminus to help
      improve the curing process. The fifth story, <i>Enlightenment</i> Sees the TARDIS Materialize abord an Edwardian clipper ship piloted by Eternals who live outside of time and require Ephemerals or time dewellers to survive.
      These Eternals are in a race for Enlightement, the story ends with Turlough breaking the Black Guardian's hold on him, and draining his power for the time being, this story is the second of my favorites this season. 
      The sixth story, <i>The King's Demons</i> Sees the TARDIS materialize in 1215 before the Magna Carta is about to be signed, with King John seemingly in two places at once. This second King ends up being 
      a robot that's controlled by the Master, to try and change history. The last story is <i>The Five Doctors</i>, which has the Doctor's timeline split as he is scooped up by the timescoop and placed in the Death Zone, 
      which is located in the center of Time Lord Civilization on Galifrey. The Doctors' have to get to Rassilon's Tomb in the center of the zone, where President Berusa Confronted them and tried to claim immortality. This story
      was the third of my favorites this season.</p>
      <p>All in all it was a wonderful season, being propped up at the end by the 2h30m special, I was sad to see Nyssa go, but ultimately we gained a great (if somewhat questionable) character in Turlough.</p>

      <h2><i>Star Wars: Tales of the Empire</i> thoughts (a tad late)</h2>
      <p><b>7-12-24</b></p>
      <p>So first off let me just say that the animation is just absolutely gorgeous, and I cannot believe how good Greivous looks (although given that it's the first time we've seen him since <i>The Clone Wars</i>, 
      I think it's expected),  and Thrawn looks absolutely stunning in the TCW style.</p>
      <p>The first three episodes are interesting, and I love to see a fleshed out backstory for Morgan Elsbeth. The last 3 episodes are something I have wanted since <i>The Clone Wars</i>, to see what happens to 
      Bariss Offee after Her trial in TCW.</p>
      <p>All in all It was a great miniseries, and the extra lore is always something I will enjoy.</p>

      <h2><i>Minecraft</i> Version History Playthrough (1.0.0/1.1)</h2>
      <p><b>6/30/24</b></p>
      <p>A week or so back I had this Idea to play through every single major <i>Minecraft</i> Update so I could a) start a long term world and b) learn how to properly play the game. I originally started with version 1.0.0,
      but I then realized version 1.1 was mostly a QoL update, so I quickly upgraded the world. I soon got into the groove of things, completing several Achievements (in the milestone sense of the word, now known as Advancments) 
      along the way. I eventually took to clearing most of the surrounding forest and lighting up the rest of the area, and now I have a nice base of operations and spawn area. I have started the "On A Rail" Achievement, 
      which requires one to create a railway 1000 blocks long (or 1km). I still have to create a strip mine so I can find diamonds, but for now I'm living pretty well. I may end up streaming the rest of the updates after 
      I finish Trade School.</p>
      <p>Note: If you have Intel Integerated Graphics and Windows 11, you might have trouble getting the saves to work in versions older than 1.8 because of a graphical bug.</p>

      <h2>Website Issues in Firefox</h2>
      <p><b>6/24/24</b></p>
      <p>While I was adding the Media page, I noticed that <i>Firefox</i> has this weird issue where it displays basic HTML wrong. I added a link to the navbar for the page, and it is not formatting the navbar with any of
      the css elements I added, which work perfectly fine on a Chromium-based browser like <i>MS Edge</i>.</p> 
      <p>I couldn't figure out how to resolve this issue via HTML so for now I would suggest using a Chromium-based browser to view the webpage, as that is what I am using to develop it. If you have the know-how, 
      or even an idea on how to fix it, please contact me.</p>
      <p>Update: They fixed the navbar issue so use whatever browser you like :).<p>

      <h2><i>Fallout 4</i> Modding Retry (Success)</h2>
      <p><b>6/17/24</b></p>
      <p>I decided to try to mod <i>Fallout 4</i> again, and it turned out quite differently this time than it did before, as I decided to not only follow some guides for a more stable <i>Fallout 4</i> 
      (<a href="https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/intro.html">This one</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/3769/">This one</a>), but to learn a new mod manager
      (Mod Organizer 2 (will be refered to as MO2 from here on)). It was fairly easy following the guides, but learning MO2 was a bit tougher, though I am a fairly quick learner.</p> 
      <p>Once I got the base down, I hadn't experienced any hitches so I started installing mods on top. I built my modlist up to ~220 mods and then I tested it, and it worked flawlessly.
      But It didn't last long, because when I played for a bit longer and got to the bridge between Sanctuary Hills and Red Rocket, the bridge had no collision. so I looked it up and it turned out that
      the mod <i>Previsibines Repair Pack</i> had to be loaded at the bottom of the load order and that it was best to sort my load order with a tool called <i>Load Order Optimization Tool</i> (LOOT for short)
      which I had been avoiding because it completely messed up my load order last time. After I had gotten that sorted I had to restart to see the effects, which is extraneous because of the fact you have to
      play through the extremely script-heavy Pre-War sequence every time. So I downloaded a mod that allowed me to skip the Pre-War sequence and come out of Vault 111 with a basic set of loot. I had no issues
      the first time I used it, but after some of another mod's scripts got "overwritten" the mod started throwing up a modal dialouge every time I loaded into a game, so when I started a new game, the
      modal dialog tried to pop up, which interfered with the Fast Start mod. I was able to remove it, because thankfully I had no other mods that depended on it.</p>
      <p>I continued installing more mods, using <i>LOOT</i> to sort the LO after every mod. Eventually I installed a mod called <i>Pip-Boy Flashlight</i> because I thought it would help the atmosphere of the game,
      but the mod ended up causing a conflict with a Pip=Boy replacer mod that I used. At first I thought I had reached the BA2 limit, so I extracted the Pip-Boy replacer mod, but it didn't help, so I went to 
      download another replace mod, but I saw that it had a patch for the mod <i>Pip-Boy Flashlight</i>, so I looked to see if the mod had a patch, and it did, but I decided that I didn't actually need the other mod,
      so I just uninstalled it.<p>
      <p>I am now sitting happily at 320 mods, with a perfectly running game. This just goes to show, with the right know-how and enough elbow grease, you can get anything working well. I may eventually decide that
      I want that last mod, and install the patch, but for now I'm happy as can be (for a <i>Bethesda</i> game, and one that is as f*cked as <i>Fallout 4</i> is, that is).</p>
